## Snapchat Magic – Real-Time AI Background Replacement

A real-time AI-powered background replacement project inspired by Snapchat filters. This application captures live webcam input and seamlessly replaces the background with a static image using Python and computer vision techniques.



### 🎯 **Aim**

To develop a real-time AI-based tool that replicates Snapchat’s background replacement effect by detecting a person in the webcam feed and substituting the background with a custom image using Python and OpenCV.



### 🧠 **Objectives**

* Learn and implement real-time video processing.
* Explore concepts in computer vision and image segmentation.
* Apply OpenCV to detect and replace backgrounds dynamically.
* Simulate Snapchat-like visual effects through Python scripting.



### 🛠 **Tech Stack**

* **Language:** Python
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* **Libraries:**

  * `opencv-python` (cv2)
  * `mediapipe`
  * `numpy`
  * `os`
